# Auto-Login Debug Findings

## Issue Summary
The auto-login isn't working because the webhook that should set the login token when a payment is processed didn't execute properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database State
- **Purchase found**: ✅ The test purchase exists in the database
- **Payment status**: ✅ Set to "paid" 
- **Login token**: ❌ **NOT SET** (this is the main issue)
- **Token expiry**: ❌ NULL (because token wasn't set)

### 2. Webhook Logic Test
When manually simulating the webhook logic:
- ✅ Webhook logic works correctly
- ✅ Login token gets generated and stored
- ✅ Recent-purchase API would find the purchase
- ✅ Auto-login flow would work

### 3. The Problem
The issue is that the **webhook endpoint (`/api/plugandpay/webhook`) wasn't called** or failed during the actual payment processing.

## Key Files Analyzed

### `/src/app/api/plugandpay/webhook/route.ts`
- Webhook endpoint that processes PlugAndPay payments
- Generates login tokens for auto-login
- Logic is correct when tested manually

### `/src/app/api/auth/recent-purchase/route.ts`
- Looks for purchases in the last 2 minutes
- Requires `login_token` to be set and `login_token_used` to be false
- Works correctly when token is present

### `/src/app/welcome/page.tsx`
- Polls the recent-purchase API every 5 seconds
- Times out after 2 minutes
- Logic is correct

## Debugging Steps Completed

1. ✅ Created database debugging script (`scripts/debug-auto-login.ts`)
2. ✅ Created webhook testing script (`scripts/manual-webhook-test.ts`)
3. ✅ Created API testing script (`scripts/test-api.ts`)
4. ✅ Created Vercel logs checking script (`scripts/check-vercel-logs.sh`)

## Test Results

### Database Query Results
```
Recent purchases (last hour): 1 found
- Email: test@example.com
- Login token: NOT SET ❌
- Token used: false
- Token expires: null
```

### Manual Webhook Simulation
```
✅ Webhook logic works correctly
✅ Login token generated: r2ptwefx30lspdy224vv89
✅ Recent-purchase API would find the purchase
```

## Next Steps to Complete Debugging

1. **Check Vercel logs** for webhook endpoint calls:
   ```bash
   npm run check-vercel-logs
   ```

2. **Test the actual webhook endpoint** on production:
   ```bash
   npm run test-webhook test@example.com
   ```

3. **Check if PlugAndPay is configured correctly**:
   - Verify webhook URL is set to: `https://your-domain.com/api/plugandpay/webhook`
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check if webhooks are enabled in PlugAndPay dashboard

## Immediate Fix
If the webhook wasn't called, you can manually fix the current purchase by running:
```bash
npm run manual-webhook-test test@example.com
```

This will set the login token for the existing purchase and make auto-login work.

## Scripts Created
- `npm run debug-auto-login` - Check database state
- `npm run manual-webhook-test <email>` - Manually simulate webhook
- `npm run test-webhook <email>` - Test webhook endpoint  
- `npm run test-api` - Test API endpoints
- `npm run check-vercel-logs` - Check Vercel logs (requires Vercel CLI)
